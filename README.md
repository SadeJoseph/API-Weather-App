# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

Our task was to create a weather dashboard using an API key. 
I had to use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. 
The App would allow users to see he weather forcast for the city of their choice whilst also displaying:
- The date
- Icon representing conditions
- Temoparature
- Humidity 
- Wind speed
